## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The project works on python 3 jupyter notebook and you will have to install the libraries numpy, pandas and matplotlib. Though there should be no problem running the code if you have Anaconda distribution of Python 3 or above.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available used to answer the above questions. The notebook is self explanatory in following the full process to answer the questions.  Markdown cells are used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is also the stackoverflow 2017 data in a zip file in this repo taken from Udacity which inturn took from Kaggle. There are two files corresponding to it, one having the data and other having the schema of the data.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The results of my analysis can be found on my blog post [here](https://medium.com/@bhathejagautam/insights-about-software-development-field-use-them-for-your-benefit-9ad0a70ed1bf).
Also, I have presented my results in the markdown cells of the above notebook, if someone likes to see the code with the results.
